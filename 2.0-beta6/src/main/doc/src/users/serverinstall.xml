	<title>Server software installation</title>
	<para>
		In this section, we explain how you can install a Sesame HTTP 
		Server. You can skip this if you are not planning to run a Sesame
		server but intend to use Sesame as a library to program against.

		<title>Required software</title>

		<para>
			The Sesame server software requires the following software:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>Java 5 or newer</listitem>
			<listitem>
				A Java Servlet Container that supports Java Servlet API 2.4 and
				Java Server Pages (JSP) 2.0, or newer. We recommend using a
				recent, stable version of
				<ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink>.
				At the time of writing, this is either version 5.5.x or 6.x.

		<title>Sesame server installation</title>
		<para>
			The Sesame 2.0 server software comes in the form of two Java Web
			Applications: <emphasis>Sesame (HTTP) server</emphasis> and
			<emphasis>OpenRDF Workbench</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sesame Server provides HTTP access to Sesame repositories and is
			meant to be accessed by other applications. Apart from some
			functionality to view the server's log messages, it doesn't provide
			any user oriented functionality. Instead, the user oriented
			functionality is part of OpenRDF Workbench. OpenRDF Workbench
			provides a web interface for querying, updating and exploring the
			repositories of a Sesame Server.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you have not done so already, you will first need to download the
			<ulink url="http://www.openrdf.org/download.jsp">Sesame 2.0 SDK</ulink>.
			Both Sesame Server and OpenRDF Workbench can be found in the
			<filename>war</filename> directory of the SDK. The war-files in this
			directory need to be deployed in a Java Servlet Container (see
			<xref linkend="section-server-required-software"/>). The deployment
			process is container-specific, please consult the documentation for
			your container on how to deploy a web application.
		</para>
		<para>
			After you have deployed the Sesame Server webapp, you should be able
			to access it, by default, at path <filename>/openrdf-sesame</filename>.
			You can point your browser at this location to verify that the
			deployment succeeded. Your browser should show the Sesame welcome
			screen as well as some options to view the server logs, among other
			things. Similarly, after deployment, the OpenRDF Workbench should be
			available at path <filename>/openrdf-workbench</filename>.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Logging Configuration</title>
		<para>
			Both Sesame Server and OpenRDF Workbench use the
			<ulink url="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">Apache log4j</ulink>
			logging framework. In its default configuration, all Sesame Server
			log messages are sent to the log file
			<filename>[ADUNA_DATA]/OpenRDF Sesame/logs/main.log</filename>
			(and log messages for the Workbench to the same file in
			<filename>[ADUNA_DATA]/OpenRDF workbench</filename>). See
			<xref linkend="chapter-datadir-config"/> for more info about data
			directories.
		</para>
		<para>
			The default log level is <parameter>INFO</parameter>, indicating
			that only important status messages, warnings and errors are logged.
			The log level can be adjusted by modifying the
			<filename>.../logs/log4j.properties</filename> file. To set the log
			level to, for example, <parameter>DEBUG</parameter> level, modify
			the line setting the log level for the org.openrdf classes:
			<screen>log4j.logger.org.openrdf=DEBUG</screen>
			For other logging configuration options, please consult the log4j
			documentation.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Repository Configuration</title>
		<para>
			A clean installation of a Sesame Server has a single repository by
			default: the SYSTEM repository. This SYSTEM repository contains all
			configuration data for the server, including data on which other
			repositories exists and (in future releases) the access rights on
			these repositories. This SYSTEM repository <emphasis>should
					not</emphasis> be used to store data that is not related to
			the server configuration.
		</para>
		<para>
			For now, the easiest way to create and manage repositories in a SYSTEM
			repository is to use the Sesame Console. The Sesame Console is a
			command-line application for interacting with Sesame, a UI-version of
			this application is currently being developed. See
			<xref linkend="chapter-console"/>.
