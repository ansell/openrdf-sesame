 * This connection can then be used to query and/or update the contents of the
 * repository. Depending on the implementation of the repository, it may or may
 * not support multiple concurrent connections.

 * Please note that a repository needs to be initialized before it can be used
 * and that it should be shut down before it is discarded/garbage collected.
 * Forgetting the latter can result in loss of data (depending on the Repository
 * implementation)!
