	<title>Setting up to use the Sesame libraries</title>
	<para>
		In this chapter, we explain some basics about setting up your
		application development environment to work with Sesame. In <xref
			linkend="chapter-repository-api"/> we go into details of the use
		of the APIs. If you do not want to program against the Sesame
		libraries but just want to install and run the Sesame HTTP server,
		please skip ahead to <xref linkend="chapter-server-install"/>.

		<title>Downloading the libraries</title>
		<para>
			As was explained in <xref linkend="chapter-download"/>, various
			download options are available to you. The quickest way to get
			started with using the Sesame libraries is to download the Sesame
			<emphasis>onejar</emphasis> library and include it in your classpath. 	
		</para>
		<para>
			However, it is important to note that the Sesame Framework consists
			of a set of libraries: Sesame is not a monolithic piece of software,
			you can pick and choose which parts you want and which ones you
			don't. In those cases where you don't care about picking and
			choosing and just want to get on with it, the onejar is a good
			choice. If, however, you want a little more control over what is
			included, you can download the complete SDK and select (from the
			<filename>lib</filename> directory) those sesame libraries that you
			require.
		</para>
		<para>
			An alternative to picking libraries by hand is to use
			maven. <ulink href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache
			    Maven</ulink> is a software management tool that
			helps you by offering things like library version
			management and dependency management (which is very
			useful because it means that once you decide you need a
			particular Sesame library, maven automatically
			downloads all the libraries that your library of choice
			requires in turn), and giving you a handy-dandy build
			environment. For details on how to start using maven,
			we advise you to take a look at the Apache Maven
			website at <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/"/>. If
			you are familiar with Maven, here are a few pointers to
			help set up your maven project.
		</para>
	    <para>
		The groupId for all Sesame core artifacts is
		<filename>org.openrdf.sesame</filename>.  For many projects you
		will need only a part of the Sesame framework. For example, if
		you require functionality for quick in-memory storage and
		querying of RDF, you will only need to include dependencies on
		the SAIL repository module (artifactId
		<filename>sesame-repository-sail</filename>) and the in-memory
		storage backend module (artifactId
		<filename>sesame-sail-memory</filename>).
	    </para>
	    <para>
		To include a maven dependency in your project that
		automatically gets you the entire Sesame core framework, use
		artifactId <filename>sesame-runtime</filename>.

		<title>Logging: SLF4J initialization</title>
		<para>
			Before you begin using the Sesame libraries, one important
			configuration step needs to be taken: the initialization and
			configuration of a logging framework.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sesame uses the <ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org/">Simple Logging
				Facade for Java (SLF4J)</ulink>, which is a framework for
			abstracting from the actual logging implementation. SLF4J allows
			you, as a user of the Sesame framework, to plug in your own favorite
			logging implementation at deployment time. SLF4J supports the most
			popular logging implementations such as Java Logging, Apache Commons
			Logging, Logback, log4j, etc. See the SLF4J website for more info.
		</para>
		<para>
			What you need to do is to determine/decide which
			logging implementation you (are going to) use and
			include the appropriate SLF4J-bridge jar-file in your
			classpath. For example, if you decide to use <ulink
			    url="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">Apache
			    log4j</ulink>, you need to include the
			SLF4J-to-log4j bridge in your classpath. The SLF4J
			release packages include bridges to various logging
			implementations; just download the SLF4J release
			package and include the appropriate bridge in your
			classpath (or, when using Maven, set the appropriate
			dependency); <filename>slf4j-logj12-1.6.1.jar</filename>,
			for example. That's all!
