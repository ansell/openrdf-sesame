	<title>Short introduction to Sesame's components</title>
	<para>
		Before diving into the internals of Sesame, we will start with a short
		introduction to Sesame by giving a high-level overview of its components.
		It's important to have some basic knowledge about this as the rest of
		this document will often refer to various components that are touched
		upon here. It is assumed that the reader has at least some basic
		knowledge about RDF, RDF Schema, OWL, etc. If this is not the case, some
		introductory articles can be found at the following locations:

	<para>
		We will try to explain the Sesame framework using the following figure,
		which shows the most prominent components and APIs in Sesame and how
		they are built on top of each other. Each component/API depends on the
		components/APIs that are beneath them.

	<para> 
		All the way at the bottom of the diagram is the RDF Model, the
		foundation of the Sesame framework. Being an RDF-oriented framework,
		all parts of Sesame are to some extent dependent on this RDF model,
		which defines interfaces and implementation for all basic RDF
		entities: URI, blank node, literal and statement.
	</para>
	<para>
		Rio, which stands for "RDF I/O", consists of a set of parsers and
		writers for various RDF file formats. The parsers can be used to
		translate RDF files to sets of statements, and the writers for the
		reverse operation. Rio can also be used independent of the rest of
		Sesame.
	</para>
	<para> 
		The Storage And Inference Layer (Sail) API is a low level System API
		(SPI) for RDF stores and inferencers. Its purpose is to abstract from
		the storage and inference details, allowing various types of storage and
		inference to be used. The Sail API is mainly of interest for those who
		are developing Sail implementations, for all others it suffices to know
		how to create and configure one. There are several implementations of
		the Sail API, for example the <classname>MemoryStore</classname> which
		stores RDF data in main memory, and the
		<classname>NativeStore</classname> which uses dedicated on-disk data
		structures for storage.
	</para>
	<para> 
		The Repository API is a higer level API that offers a large number of
		developer-oriented methods for handling RDF data. The main goal of this
		API is to make the life of application developers as easy as possible.
		It offers various methods for uploading data files, querying, and
		extracting and manipulating data. There are several implementations of
		this API, the ones shown in this figure are the
		<classname>SailRepository</classname> and the
		<classname>HTTPRepository</classname>. The former translates calls to a
		Sail implementation of choice, the latter offers transparent
		client-server communication with a Sesame server over HTTP.
	</para>
	<para>
		The top-most component in the diagram is the HTTP Server. The HTTP
		Server consists of a number of Java Servlets that implement a protocol
		for accessing Sesame repositories over HTTP. The details of this
		protocol can be found in Sesame's system documentation, but most people
		can simply use a client library to handle the communication. The
		<classname>HTTPClient</classname> that is used by the
		<classname>HTTPRepository</classname> is one such library.
	</para>
	<para>
		While each part of the Sesame code is publicly available and extensible,
		most application developers will be primarily interested in the
		Repository API. This API is described in more detail in one of the
		following chapters.
